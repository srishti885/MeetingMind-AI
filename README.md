MeetingMind AI: Neural Enterprise Collaboration System
Executive Overview
MeetingMind AI is a high-performance neural operating system designed to eliminate information decay in corporate environments. By leveraging advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and neural audio processing, the platform transforms unstructured meeting data into structured, actionable intelligence.

The system provides end-to-end automation for transcription, multi-speaker diarization, sentiment analysis, and automated task delegation, ensuring that organizational collective wisdom is preserved in a secure, searchable digital vault.

Technical Architecture
Core Engine
Neural Processing: Powered by Llama 3.3 for high-fidelity summarization and context extraction.

Audio Intelligence: Implements neural audio decoding for precise speaker identification and noise cancellation.

Sentiment Analytics: Proprietary scoring algorithms to determine meeting tone and team alignment.

Security Framework
Zero-Knowledge Privacy: Ensuring enterprise data isolation.

End-to-End Encryption: All records in the Intelligence Vault are encrypted at rest and in transit.

Authentication: Multi-role access control (Admin/User) for secure organizational deployment.

Key Modules
1. Neural Studio
A centralized workspace for real-time analysis of audio and video assets. The studio handles file processing through an asynchronous pipeline with real-time status telemetry.

2. Intelligence Vault
A secure digital archive for all processed organizational records. Includes features for metadata filtering, keyword search, and storage management.

3. Automated Reporting
Executive Summaries: Concise intelligence reports generated automatically.

Actionable Items: Context-aware task extraction with owner assignment.

Cross-Platform Sync: Integrated with corporate calendars and communication channels via EmailJS.
